      Earlier we said that vipassana is the process of continually noticing your experience and the sensations that it comprises. 

      One way to do this is with the *noting technique*, where you use one or two word labels to describe whatever youâ€™re experiencing, every few seconds. 

      Whenever more than a few seconds have passed and you haven't noted, that's your sign to return to the technique.
