        Earlier we said that vipassana is the process of continually noticing your experience and the sensations that it comprises. 

        One way to do this is with the *noting technique*, where one or two word labels are used to describe whatever youâ€™re experiencing, every few seconds. 

        Labeling your experience is not an end in itself, rather it is a tool to help you remain aware of what's going on without getting stuck.
