        Learning to meditate is like learning to play the guitar or speak a foreign language; the more you practice, the better you'll get! 

        Set aside time each day for meditation. Start with five or ten minute sessions, and set a timer. Sit comfortably on a chair, sofa, or cushion, and try to note every two or three seconds.

        When I sit to meditate, I like to note aloud; it's easier to stay on track that way compared to noting silently.
