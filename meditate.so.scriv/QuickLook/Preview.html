<p class="binderItem"><strong>Meditation comprises a variety of techniques that target</strong><br/>Meditation comprises a variety of techniques that target the functioning of the mind. It can lead to profound perceptual and cognitive transformations that have traditonally been called spiritual enlightenment or awakening.<br/>
<br/>
Turtle: It might be more accurate to say *enlightenments* or *awaken-ing*, since the results of meditation are neither uniform nor steady state. </p>
</li>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Meditation can make you feel good, but it can also</strong><br/>Meditation can make you feel good, but it can also be boring, stressful, and frustrating at times.<br/>
<br/>
Turtle: It’s not a linear development of feeling better and better. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Not about stopping thoughts</strong><br/>Meditation is not about stopping your thoughts. Success is not determined by how few thoughts you have. <br/>
<br/>
Turtle: You might be shocked by how many thoughts you notice as soon as you sit down to meditate. That’s okay! </p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Vipassana</strong><br/>There are many kinds of meditation techniques that produce myriad results.<br/>
We’re going to focus on *vipassana* or *insight meditation*, which is the process of continually noticing your experience and the sensations that it comprises. <br/>
<br/>
Turtle: The kind of vipassana we’re talking about has its roots in Theravada Buddhism.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Buddhism</strong><br/>Although meditation comes from Buddhism, it has continued to evolve since coming to the West. As meditation has made its way into schools, hospitals, and workplaces, many teachers have developed a secular approach to these ancient practices. <br/>
<br/>
Shoshana Cooper quote<br/>
<br/>
Turtle: It’s possible to divorce meditation from the religious trappings of its history, and look at it as as a technology for living a better life.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Noting</strong><br/>Earlier we said that vipassana is the process of continually noticing your experience and the sensations that it comprises. One way to do this is with the *noting technique*, where you use one word labels to describe whatever you’re experiencing. Every few seconds, you name whatever is taking center stage in that moment and note it silently or aloud.<br/>
<br/>
Turtle: Sound confusing? We’ll demonstrate in just a second!</p>

</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>four foundations</strong><br/>Now that we have a taste of noting, we’re going to explore a more robust framework for noting: the Four Foundations of Mindfulness. <br/>
<br/>
Turtle: The Four Foundations of Mindfulness come from Buddhism. This interpretation is again from Kenneth Folk.</p>
